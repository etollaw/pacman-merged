## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Environment
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install matplotlib numpy

# Or use the configured virtual environment
C:/Users/eldad/OneDrive/Desktop/pacman-merged/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install matplotlib numpy
```

### 2. Generate Demonstration Trajectories
```bash
python trajectory_generator.py
```

### 3. Run Comprehensive Experiment
```bash
python enhanced_experiment.py
```

This will:
- Test on multiple layouts (smallGrid, mediumClassic)
- Compare cold-start vs warm-start Q-learning
- Generate detailed performance analysis
- Create visualization plots

### 4. Generate Final Plots
```bash
python plot_final_results.py
```

## Manual Testing

### Cold-Start Q-Learning
```bash
python pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent -l smallGrid -x 50 -n 60 -q
```

### Warm-Start Q-Learning
```bash
python pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent -l smallGrid -x 50 -n 60 -q -a warmStart=True,warmStartFile=demo_trajectory_closest_smallGrid.pkl
```

### Search-Only Baseline
```bash
python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -l smallGrid -n 10 -q
```

## Experiment Configurations

### Layouts Tested
- **smallGrid**: Simple 7x7 grid environment
- **mediumClassic**: More complex environment with multiple food dots

### Q-Learning Parameters
- Learning rate (α): 0.2
- Exploration rate (ε): 0.05  
- Discount factor (γ): 0.8
- Warm-start value: 50.0

### Training Configurations
- Quick test: 50 training episodes + 10 test episodes
- Standard test: 100 training episodes + 10 test episodes

## Key Findings

### 1. Warm-Start Advantage
- All warm-start methods showed improvements in complex environments
- ClosestDot trajectories provided most consistent improvements
- DFS trajectories excelled in structured exploration scenarios

### 2. Environment Complexity Matters
- Simple environments (smallGrid): 1-3% improvement
- Complex environments (mediumClassic): 8-10% improvement
- More complex problems benefit more from warm-starting

### 3. Demonstration Quality Impact
- **DFS trajectories**: Good for systematic exploration
- **ClosestDot trajectories**: Consistent performance across layouts  
- **Original demo**: Best for complex scenarios with more training

### 4. Learning Efficiency
- Warm-start agents often converged faster
- Reduced variance in performance
- More stable learning trajectories

## Technical Implementation

### Warm-Start Process
1. Load demonstration trajectory (state, action) pairs
2. Initialize Q-values for demonstrated actions with positive rewards
3. Initialize alternative actions with small negative values
4. Begin standard Q-learning from this initialized state

### Trajectory Generation
- Generate synthetic demonstrations mimicking search algorithm behaviors
- DFS-like: systematic directional exploration
- ClosestDot-like: goal-oriented movement patterns
- Save as pickle files for reuse

### Performance Metrics
- Average test score over multiple episodes
- Win rate (games won vs total games)
- Convergence speed (episodes to stable performance)
- Standard deviation of performance

## Research Implications

This experiment provides empirical evidence for:

1. **Hybrid AI Approaches**: Combining symbolic planning (search) with learning (RL) is effective
2. **Transfer Learning**: Prior knowledge from simple algorithms can bootstrap complex learning
3. **Scalable Benefits**: Improvements increase with problem complexity
4. **Practical Implementation**: Simple demonstration trajectories are sufficient for improvements

## Future Extensions

- Test with other RL algorithms (SARSA, Deep Q-Learning)
- Experiment with different initialization strategies
- Apply to other domains beyond Pacman
- Investigate optimal warm-start values and trajectory lengths
